John Conway's Game of Life

Write a Java program to implement the Game of Life, as defined by John Conway:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Your program should use a 20 x 20 grid, and accept the initial grid configuration in a form similar to the following (this example would be for a 4 x 4 grid):

OOOO

OXXO

OXXO

OOOO

Where ‘X’ (upper case) indicates and inhabited square and ‘O’ (upper case Oh, not zero)  indicates an empty square.  Your program should then accept an integer value indicating the number of generations to compute, and show the final configuration in the same format as the input.

Think about proper class design, loosely-coupled classes, testability, etc.
